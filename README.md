Engineered an AI client in C++ as part of a team, enabling efficient interaction with a game
server using client-server architecture. Integrated real-time communication with the server us-
ing net::Client, focusing on network protocol adherence and message parsing. Implemented AI
algorithms to process game states and make strategic decisions, demonstrating skills in C++ pro-
gramming and algorithmic thinking. Designed the client for robust performance, including han-
dling end-game scenarios, which refined problem-solving and software development skills.
