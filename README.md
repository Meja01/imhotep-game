Engineered an AI client in C++ as part of a team, enabling efficient interaction with a game
server using a client-server architecture. Integrated real-time communication with the server 
using net::Client, focusing on network protocol adherence and message parsing. Implemented AI
algorithms to process game states and make strategic decisions, demonstrating skills in C++ pro-
programming and algorithmic thinking. Designed the client for robust performance, including handling 
end-game scenarios, which refined problem-solving and software development skills.
